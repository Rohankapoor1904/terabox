# Known Limitations

## TeraBox Share URLs vs Direct File URLs

### ⚠️ Important Limitation

The current API implementation is designed for **direct file URLs** only. It does **NOT** support TeraBox share URLs.

### What's the Difference?

#### ❌ Share URLs (NOT Supported)
Share URLs are web pages that require browser interaction:
- Format: `https://terabox.com/s/...` or `https://1024terabox.com/s/...`
- Example: `https://1024terabox.com/s/101DnuoFFS79EoKYdzfcD7g`
- These are **landing pages** that display file information
- Require JavaScript execution to generate download links
- May include captcha or authentication challenges
- Cannot be downloaded via simple HTTP GET requests

**Error when using share URLs:**
```json
{
  "error": "File not accessible",
  "message": "Unable to access the requested file"
}
```

#### ✅ Direct File URLs (Supported)
Direct file URLs point to actual file content:
- Format: Direct CDN or file server URLs
- Example: `https://[cdn-domain]/path/to/actual/file.ext`
- These URLs return file content directly
- Can be downloaded with standard HTTP GET requests
- No JavaScript or browser interaction needed

### Why Share URLs Don't Work

1. **HTML Response**: Share URLs return HTML pages, not file content
2. **JavaScript Required**: The actual download URL is generated by JavaScript
3. **Dynamic Links**: Download URLs may be temporary or session-specific
4. **Authentication**: May require cookies, tokens, or captcha completion
5. **HEAD Request Limitation**: Share pages don't respond properly to HEAD requests for file validation

### Technical Details

The current API workflow:
```
1. Validate URL domain ✅
2. Send HEAD request to check accessibility
3. Send GET request to download file
```

This works for direct file URLs but fails for share URLs because:
- HEAD request to share URL returns HTML page headers (status 200)
- GET request to share URL downloads HTML page, not the file
- The actual file download URL is hidden in the page's JavaScript

### Workaround

To use this API, you need to:

1. **Extract the direct download URL** from TeraBox:
   - Open the share link in a browser
   - Use browser developer tools to find the actual file URL
   - The direct URL is usually generated when you click "Download"
   - Copy the direct file URL (not the share URL)

2. **Use the direct URL with this API**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/download \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "DIRECT_FILE_URL_HERE"}' \
     --output filename.ext
   ```

### Potential Solutions (Future Enhancement)

Implementing share URL support would require:

#### Option 1: Headless Browser (Complex)
- Use Puppeteer or Playwright
- Navigate to share page
- Execute JavaScript
- Extract download URL
- Handle captcha/authentication
- **Challenges**: Resource-intensive, slow, may violate ToS

#### Option 2: Reverse Engineer TeraBox API (Complex)
- Analyze TeraBox's internal API calls
- Replicate authentication flow
- Extract download URLs programmatically
- **Challenges**: May break with TeraBox updates, unclear legal status

#### Option 3: HTML Parsing (Limited)
- Parse share page HTML
- Look for download URLs in page source
- **Challenges**: May not work if URLs are JavaScript-generated

### Current Status

**The API is working as designed for direct file URLs.**

The limitation with share URLs is a fundamental architectural constraint, not a bug. Supporting share URLs would require significant changes and may not be feasible without browser automation.

### Testing

The previously tested URLs were also share URLs:
- `https://1024terabox.com/s/1P_xGtx4gVi8LRgTfNgXmFQ` (Image share URL)
- `https://1024terabox.com/s/19WoZYNIPDTd3VV2ajZdFtA` (Video share URL)
- `https://1024terabox.com/s/101DnuoFFS79EoKYdzfcD7g` (Latest test)

All returned "File not accessible" errors because they are share pages, not direct file URLs.

The error responses were correct behavior - the API correctly identified that it couldn't access the file (because share URLs don't provide direct file access).

### Recommendation

**For direct file downloads from TeraBox:**
1. Use TeraBox's official tools or web interface
2. Extract direct download URLs manually
3. Use those direct URLs with this API

**For automated share URL handling:**
This would require a separate project with browser automation capabilities.

**Status**: Share URL support is not implemented and is not planned in the current scope due to technical complexity and potential ToS concerns.
